## 👋 Hi, I am Ashita!

📊 I am a **_data scientist_**, who performs analysis and uses machine learning models to suit the business requirement. Along with carrying out data analysis, I love a tint of management in order to be able to scale my analysis to the changes required.

### ⚒️ Work Experience
My previous job involved a lot of analysis with the aim to highlight critical aspects of the product and its performance. Furthermore, I worked towards using the insights to recommend better approaches to a problem. Additionally, I also managed a few product development aspects from ideation phase to execution with the help of my team members.
I've worked on various Computer Vision projects during the tenure of my internships, that expanded on my model development and deployment knowledge.

### 🔖 Currently learning
- Learning more about model deployment and best practises
- Working on improving my knowledge on data analytics, and product analytics
- Learning more BI tools
- Sometimes, even a bit of Product Management for fun
