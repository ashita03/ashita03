## 👋 Hi, I am Ashita!

📊 I am a data scientist, who performs analysis and uses machine learning models to suit the business requirement. Along with carrying out data analysis, I love a tint of management in order to be able to scale my analysis to the changes required.

### ⚒️ Work Experience

Furthermore, I worked towards using the insights to recommend better approaches to a problem. Additionally, I also managed a few product development aspects from ideation phase to execution with the help of my team members.

### 🔖 Currently learning

- Sometimes, even a bit of Product Management for fun
